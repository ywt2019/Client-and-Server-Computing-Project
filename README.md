# Client and Server Computing Project
 - (Task 0) Got two pairs of Java-based UDP and TCP server and client connected on local network, built byte arrays in client and send them as datagram packets to server
 - (Task 1) Wrote an eavesdropper in the middle that collects message from the client, adds additional information, and sends to the server
 - (Task 2) Added proxy design to server code, client can make multiple remote procedure calls to the server for mathematical operations on a set sum, the server will send the result back as a reply
 - (Task 5) Completed a signing feature between server and client so that their messages are encrypted by RSA
