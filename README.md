# Client and Server Computing Project
 Got two pairs of Java-based UDP and TCP server and client connected on local network, built byte arrays in client and send them as datagram packets to server
 Wrote an eavesdropper in the middle that collects message from the client, adds additional information, and sends to the server
 Added proxy design to server code, client can make multiple remote procedure calls to the server for mathematical operations on a set sum, the server will send the result back as a reply
 Completed a signing feature between server and client so that their messages are encrypted by RSA
